## Pull Request Guidelines

Each pull request should be focused on one task, and include tests for new
behaviour being added.
Ensure that every pull request is associated with one or more
[issues](https://github.com/googleinterns/step30-2020/issues). If necessary,
create an issue to go along with the task you've completed in your PR.

### Reviews

Each PR should have as reviewers:

- One or both of `chyheimjb` (Chy) and `Sunlis` (Sean)
- For Java-heavy reviews, include `benjamin704` (Benjamin)
- At least one of your podmates for knowledge-sharing purposes:
`akinlabimh` (Akin), `CobenaA` (Ariel), `glanden` (Garrett)

Reviewers should approve or leave comments on a PR within 24 hours of mailing,
whenever possible. If 24 hours has passed without a response, PR owners should
message the silent reviewers and ask them to "PTAL" (please take a look) and
include a link to the PR in question.

Once all reviewers have approved and all comments have been addressed, the PR
owner should merge (using the `Create a merge commit` option). Please avoid
letting approved PRs sit stale for more than 24-48 hours - merge or close!
